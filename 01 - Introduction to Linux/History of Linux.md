# The History of Linux and Its Most Common Distributions

## The Birth of Linux

Linux was born in 1991 as a personal project by a Finnish student, Linus Torvalds⁶⁷. Inspired by the UNIX operating system, Torvalds aimed to create a new free operating system kernel⁶. The name Linux is a combination of his first name, Linus, and Unix, the operating system that inspired his projects⁷.

The initial release of Linux was a kernel, the core part of the operating system that interacts with hardware⁷. This kernel, combined with other free software, forms a complete Linux distribution¹. From its humble beginnings, Linux has grown exponentially, with its source code expanding from a small number of C files to more than 23.3 million lines of source code by 2018⁶.

## The Growth of Linux

Linux was initially used primarily by technology enthusiasts and software developers⁷. Over time, it has grown in popularity and is now used in various types of devices such as servers, smartphones, and embedded systems⁷. Today, Linux is one of the most widely used operating systems in the world, with an estimated 2.76% of all desktop computers and more than 90% of the world’s top supercomputers running on Linux⁷.

## Three Most Common Linux Distributions

### 1. Ubuntu

Ubuntu is probably the most well-known Linux distribution¹. It is based on Debian and has its own software repositories¹. Ubuntu is modern without being too bleeding edge, offering releases every six months, with a more stable Long Term Support (LTS) release every two years¹.

### 2. Fedora

Fedora is a project with a strong focus on free software¹. It is built and maintained by the Fedora Project, sponsored by Red Hat². Fedora is always in the lead of integrating new package versions and technologies into the distribution¹.

### 3. Debian

Debian is an operating system composed only of free, open-source software¹. The Debian project has been operating since 1993 and is known for moving much more slowly than distributions like Ubuntu or Linux Mint¹. This can make it more stable and conservative, which is ideal for some systems¹.

## Conclusion

From its inception as a personal project to its current status as a global phenomenon, Linux has revolutionized the world of operating systems. Its various distributions, each with their unique features and strengths, continue to power devices around the world, making Linux a cornerstone of modern computing.
